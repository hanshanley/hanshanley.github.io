I am a Research Scientist at Meta.  I am broadly interested in disinformation, networks, and natural language processing. 

I was formerly a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University researching in the [Empirical Security Research Group](https://esrg.stanford.edu/) and supported by the [Meta PhD Research Fellowship](https://research.facebook.com/blog/2023/4/announcing-the-2023-meta-research-phd-fellowship-award-winners/), the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [Stanford University EDGE Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/enhancing-diversity-graduate/details). I completed two Mastersâ€™ degrees in Computer Science and in Statistics with the [Daniel M. Sachs Scholarship](https://sachs.princeton.edu/) at the University of Oxford. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.

Outside of research, I did disinformation reporting with the [Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab](https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/programs/digital-forensic-research-lab/). For fun, I enjoy stand-up comedy, listening to UK rhythm and blues music, long-distance running, and learning Mandarin Chinese (HSK5).

I have a blog [The Margin of Error](https://www.themarginoferror.com/) where I talk about my research, computational looks at different economic and political issues, and a ton of other topics!

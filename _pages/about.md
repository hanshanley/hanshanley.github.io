I'm a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at Stanford University supervised by [Professor Zakir Durumeric](https://zakird.com/) and researching in the [Empirical Security Research Group](https://esrg.stanford.edu/). I am supported by the [National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship](https://www.nsfgrfp.org/) and the [Stanford University EDGE Fellowship](https://vpge.stanford.edu/fellowships-funding/enhancing-diversity-graduate/details). I am broadly interested in disinformation, computer security, privacy, statistics, networks, and machine learning. I completed two Mastersâ€™ degrees in Computer Science and in Statistics with the [Daniel M. Sachs Scholarship](https://sachs.princeton.edu/) at the University of Oxford. I completed my undergraduate degree in Electrical Engineering at Princeton University.

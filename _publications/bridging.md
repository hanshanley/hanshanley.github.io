Political discourse has grown increasingly fragmented across different social platforms, making it challenging to trace how narratives spread and evolve within such a fragmented information ecosystem. Reconstructing social graphs and information diffusion networks is challenging, and available strategies typically depend on platform-specific features and behavioral signals which are often incompatible across systems and increasingly restricted. To address these challenges, we present a platform-agnostic framework that allows to accurately and efficiently reconstruct the underlying social graph of users' cross-platform interactions, based on discovering latent narratives and users' participation therein. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in key network-based tasks: information operation detection, ideological stance prediction, and cross-platform engagement prediction––while requiring significantly less data than existing alternatives and capturing a broader set of users. When applied to cross-platform information dynamics between Truth Social and X (formerly Twitter), our framework reveals a small, mixed-platform group of bridge users, comprising just 0.33% of users and 2.14% of posts, who introduce nearly 70% of migrating narratives to the receiving platform. These findings offer a structural lens for anticipating how narratives traverse fragmented information ecosystems, with implications for cross-platform governance, content moderation, and policy interventions.

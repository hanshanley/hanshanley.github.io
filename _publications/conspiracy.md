Do we live in a "Golden Age of Conspiracy Theories?" In this work, we study the relationships between five prominent conspiracy theories (QAnon, COVID, UFO/Aliens, 9/11, and Flat-Earth) and the role that misinformation and political polarization play in spreading them. We find that from 2008 to 2021 the percentage of all external hyperlinks from misinformation websites that went to $conspiracy-oriented$ websites went from 10.2\% to 22.4\%, a 119\% relative increase. Using partial Granger-causality, we uncover positive bidirectional relationships between the hyperlinks from misinformation websites and the popularity of conspiracy theory websites, suggesting the deep role that misinformation plays in popularizing many conspiracy theories. Examining the role that political polarization plays in explaining levels of conspiratorial material online, we find that the partisanship levels of news websites have a Pearson correlation of $\rho = 0.521$ with a website's shared domain connections with conspiracy theory websites, increasing to $\rho = 0.621$ when only considering conservative-leaning websites. Combining these results, we conclude by proposing a new metric to understand websites' fringe attitudes, which scores websites based on their penchant towards conspiracy theories and their partisanship level.

In this work, we study the coordinated information campaign to understand the most prominent disinformation narratives touted by the Russian government to English-speaking audiences. To do this, we first perform sentence-level topic analysis using the large-language model MPNet on articles published by nine different Russian disinformation websites and the new Russian "fact-checking" website waronfakes. After analyzing the set of Russian information narratives, we analyze their correspondence with narratives and topics of discussion on the r/Russia and 10 other political subreddits

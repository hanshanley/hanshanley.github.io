In this work, we study how 17 Russian media outlets have interactedwith and utilized 732 Telegram channels throughout 2022. To do this, we utilize a multilingual model of MPNet fine-tuned on semantic search to embed articles and Telegram messages in shared embedding space, performing semantic comparisons across the resulting 3.9 million embeddings. Then leveraging a parallelized version of DP-Means clustering, we perform paragraph-level topic/narrative extraction and time-series analysis. With this approach, we find that 67.4% of content from our set of Telegram channels originated from Russian news websites while 35.2% of content from Russian news websites originated from Telegram. Finally, tracking the spread of individual narratives, we measure the rate at which these websites and channels disseminate content in the Russian media ecosystem.
